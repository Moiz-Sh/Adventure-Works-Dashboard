# AdventureWorks Business Intelligence Dashboard

## Introduction
This project involved developing a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) solution for AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company specializing in cycling equipment and accessories. The primary objective was to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, revenue, profit, and returns, and to compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. This project was completed as part of a data visualization course using Power BI.

## Project Overview
The project encompasses the following key components:
- **Data Collection and Transformation**
- **Relational Data Modeling**
- **Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)**
- **Interactive Dashboard Design**

## Data Collection and Transformation
Raw data was collected from various CSV files containing information on transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories. The data was then cleaned, transformed, and connected to build a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

## Relational Data Modeling
A relational data model was constructed to ensure data integrity and facilitate comprehensive analysis. This model linked the various data tables, enabling efficient data retrieval and analysis.

## Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
Using DAX, calculated columns and measures were created to derive meaningful insights from the data. This included calculations for sales, revenue, profit margins, return rates, and other relevant metrics.

## Interactive Dashboard Design
An interactive dashboard was designed to visualize the data and enable the management team to make data-driven decisions. The dashboard includes:
- **Executive Dashboard**: A high-level overview of key KPIs.
- **Regional Performance Map**: Visualization of sales and performance across different regions.
- **Product Detail Analysis**: Insights into product-level trends and performance.
- **Customer Detail Analysis**: Identification of high-value customers and their purchasing behavior.

## Files Included
- **AdventureWorks_Dashboard.pdf**: A PDF document containing snapshots of the dashboard slides.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Transformation**: Cleaning and transforming raw data from multiple sources.
- **Relational Data Modeling**: Building a relational data model to ensure data integrity.
- **DAX**: Creating calculated columns and measures to derive insights.
- **Interactive Dashboard Design**: Designing an interactive dashboard to visualize data and enable data-driven decision-making.

## Conclusion
This project honed my skills in data transformation, relational data modeling, DAX, and interactive dashboard design, demonstrating my ability to turn raw data into actionable business insights. The AdventureWorks BI Dashboard provides the management team with a powerful tool to track performance, analyze trends, and make informed decisions.
